**Explanation:**

1. **Shebang Line:** The script begins with `#!/bin/bash`, indicating that it's a Bash script.
2. **Strict Error Handling:** `set -euo pipefail` sets strict error handling to ensure the script exits immediately on any errors.
3. **Environment Setup:**
   - The script sources the `.env` file to load environment variables.
   - The `PROJECT_ROOT` variable is set to the script's directory for easy file path management.
   - Log file and PID file locations are defined.
   - Service timeouts and health check intervals are set.
4. **Functions:**
   - `log_info` and `log_error` are defined to handle logging messages with timestamps.
   - `cleanup` is defined to remove PID files and stop services on script exit.
   - `check_dependencies` is defined to check for required dependencies (you should add your specific dependency checks here).
   - `check_port` checks if a given port is available on the host machine.
   - `wait_for_service` polls a specific port until a service becomes available or a timeout is reached.
   - `verify_service` is defined to perform service health checks (add your specific health checks here).
   - `start_database` starts the database service (replace the command with your actual database startup command).
   - `start_backend` starts the backend server (replace the command with your actual backend startup command).
   - `start_frontend` starts the frontend server (replace the command with your actual frontend startup command).
   - `store_pid` saves the process ID of the currently running service to a PID file.
5. **Main Execution Flow:**
   - The `check_dependencies` function is called to verify that all required tools are present.
   - The `start_database`, `start_backend`, and `start_frontend` functions are called in sequence to start the services.
   - After the services are started, a "Startup complete." message is logged.
6. **Cleanup on Exit:**
   - The `trap` command sets cleanup handlers for the `EXIT` and `ERR` signals. This ensures that the `cleanup` function is called when the script exits normally or due to an error.

This script provides a robust and flexible framework for starting your MVP project. You can modify it to include specific dependencies, service start commands, and health check procedures based on your actual project requirements. Remember to test the script thoroughly in your development environment before deploying it to production.
